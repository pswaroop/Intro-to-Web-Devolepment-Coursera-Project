# Intro-to-Web-Devolepment-Coursera-Project
This is the Final project for the course "Introduction to Web development" Course taken in the Coursera.

In this project, I created a survey form for a food ordering website in which i included all types of inputs.
All validations of the user inputs will also be verified using the javascript code.

## Note
For viewing the output, Keep all these files in one folder/directory and open the "surveyForm.html" by using
any web browser.
